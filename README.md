This project is a simple grade calculation system developed in Assembly Language. It takes input scores for different components of a course—such as quizzes, midterms, finals, and assignments—and calculates the final numerical score and corresponding letter grade based on a predefined grading scale.

Key Features:

    Written entirely in Assembly (MASM/TASM/NASM depending on your assembler)

    Accepts user input for different grade components

    Performs arithmetic operations and logical comparisons

    Outputs total score and letter grade (A, B, C, etc.)

    Demonstrates low-level logic for decision-making and data handling

Use Case:
Ideal for understanding how control structures (like conditions and loops) and arithmetic operations work in Assembly, especially for students learning computer architecture or low-level programming.
